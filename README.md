# Welcome to Your First Coding Project in Cursor!

This is a simple project to help you get started with Python using the Cursor IDE.  
Youâ€™ll write your very first scripts here, while Cursor (with AI) acts as your tutor and guide.  
Letâ€™s explore this workspace together:

---

## Exploring the Project Files

* **`main.py`**: This is the main file where you will write your Python code. For now, this is the only file you need to focus on.
* **Other Files**: You might see files like `.cursorrules`, `requirements.txt`, or `.vscode`.  
  Donâ€™t worry about these â€” they exist to make the environment easier and to guide the AI assistant.

## Getting to Know Cursor

Your screen has a few key areas:

* **Explorer (Left Side)**: Like a file cabinet â€” it shows all project files (like `main.py`). Click a file to open it.
* **Editor (Center)**: Your workbench. This is where youâ€™ll write and edit code.
* **Terminal (Bottom)**: Your command center. Run commands here to execute your scripts and see results.
* **Cursor Chat (Right Side)**: Your AI assistant. You can ask questions about your code, concepts, or next steps.  
  Remember: the AI will explain logic simply, not overwhelm you with code details.

## Getting Started

**Good news!** A Python environment is already prepared for you. ðŸŽ‰  

When you open a terminal, you might see `(.venv)` at the start of the prompt, like this:
```
(.venv) vibecoding-02-03-68307615:$
```

### First Time Setup

If you donâ€™t see a `.venv` folder in the Explorer, set it up by typing in the terminal:

```bash
setup-venv
```

This will:
- Create a Python virtual environment
- Activate it automatically
- Install the required packages

### If Auto-Activation Doesnâ€™t Work

Type this in the terminal:

```bash
activate
```

**Note:** Thanks to the `.vscode` configuration, these helper commands (`setup-venv`, `activate`) work automatically inside Cursor.

## Your First Challenge: Understanding the Code

Before running anything, letâ€™s ask Cursor what the code means.

In the **Cursor Chat**, on the right side, type:

```text
Can you explain what the code in `main.py` does?
```

Youâ€™ll get a simple, logical explanation of what the program does, not just a code breakdown.

---

## How to Run Code

Now letâ€™s run the code you just explored:

1. Make sure `main.py` is open in the **Editor**.
2. Click into the **Terminal** at the bottom.
3. Run this command:

```bash
python main.py
```

4. You should see this message appear in the terminal:

```
Hello, world!
```

ðŸŽ‰ Congrats, you just ran your first Python program in Cursor!
